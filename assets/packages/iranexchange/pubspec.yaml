# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # To add iran_exchange_assets to your application, add an iran_exchange_assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - .env
    - pubspec.yaml
    - iran_exchange_assets/animations/
    - iran_exchange_assets/images/
    - iran_exchange_assets/images/svgs/
    - iran_exchange_assets/images/svgs/banks/
    - iran_exchange_assets/images/svgs/intro/
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding iran_exchange_assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Estedad
      fonts:
        - asset: iran_exchange_assets/fonts/Estedad-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: iran_exchange_assets/fonts/Estedad-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: iran_exchange_assets/fonts/Estedad-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: iran_exchange_assets/fonts/Estedad-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
    - family: DM-sans
      fonts:
        - asset: iran_exchange_assets/fonts/DMSans-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: iran_exchange_assets/fonts/DMSans-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: iran_exchange_assets/fonts/DMSans-Bold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: iran_exchange_assets/fonts/DMSans-Bold.ttf
